# ElleHacks23-ENVoyage
"ENV" from "environment", "voyage" from the French term for "travel". Put together, we express our hope to promote a more environmentally-conscious form of tourism.
Our application encourages users to try greener alternatives for transportation as they travel across the world. Connecting them to local public transportation, car-pooling services, bike rental services, and more at a discounted price, we hope tourists can seek more eco-friendly ways to make their way to and from each point of their itinerary.
